# Milestone Module

## Frontend

Project uses Vue3 + Vite.

Setup:
1. `.env` file needs to be populated with proper data. Available env variables
are listed in `milestone-tracker-frontend/.env.example` file.
2. Deps needs to be installed `npm install`
3. Start dev environment: `npm run dev`
4. Build:
  - In the dev environment, env variables are pulled from the `.env` file
`npx vue-inject-env set` to prepare the env variables that will be used by
the bundled package. This commands creates a separate `env.js` file in the
build folder that is loaded by the main package. This file can be updated
without building again the full project using the `npx vue-inject-env set`
command.
By default `npx vue-inject-env set` picks the variables from the `.env` file,
but value can be overridden if the same environment variables are set before
running the command:
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL='http://example.org' npx vue-inject-env set`
  - `npm run build` to prepare the bundle.

The Earthfile allow to build the project and saves the artifact in the `dist`
folder.

`earthly +build`

`earthly +set-env` will create a separate `env.js` file.

## Backend

Run a local supabase instance using docker and seed database structure and
example data.

It uses supabase-cli to spawn the various containers required.

Setup:
1. In `milestone-tracker-backend` install deps: `npm install`
2. Run `npx supabase start`. This will initialize and spawn the various
containers.

API is accessible at http://localhost:54321
Studio at http://localhost:54323

The Earthfile allow to install deps and run the containers required and it's
used for e2e testing.

### Importer

It is a set of simple CLI python scripts used to populate a running instance
from CSV export. It will be used to migrate real data from Google Sheet to the
milestone module.

### E2E tests

`milestone-tracker-tests/` includes E2E tests.

From the root of the project use earthly:

`earthly -P +e2e`

This will build the frontend and serve it, spinup the containers required by
supabase with the correct configuration and run the e2e testing.
